#  QUICK START - Don't Be Confused!

## What Happened?
I created a **web interface** for your Video-to-SOP project!

## Before vs After

### BEFORE (What you had):
`
python main.py    Upload video    Get PDF
`
- Command line only
- No user accounts
- No web interface

### AFTER (What you have now):
`
Browser    Register/Login    Upload via Web    Get PDF
`
- Beautiful web interface
- User accounts with company names
- Dashboard to manage SOPs
- Ready for deployment

##  RUN IT NOW (3 commands)

`powershell
cd d:\AI\GitHub\Video-to-SOP-Generator\webapp
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
`

Then open: **http://localhost:5000**

##  What You'll See

1. **Landing Page** (http://localhost:5000)
   - Welcome message
   - Features list
   - Login/Register buttons

2. **Registration Page**
   - Username field
   - Email field
   - **COMPANY NAME**  This goes on PDFs!
   - Password fields

3. **Dashboard** (after login)
   - View all your SOPs
   - Upload new videos
   - Download PDFs
   - Track processing status

4. **Generate Page**
   - Drag & drop video upload
   - Enter SOP title
   - Click "Generate"

5. **Processing Page**
   - Real-time progress bar
   - Shows: Extract frames  Transcribe  Analyze  Generate PDF

6. **Download Page**
   - Download your PDF
   - Create another SOP
   - Go back to dashboard

##  Your Original Code Still Works!

Don't worry! Your original files are UNCHANGED:
-  main.py - Still works
-  video_processor.py - Still works
-  whisper_transcription.py - Still works
-  sop_analyzer.py - Still works
-  pdf_generator.py - Still works

The frontend just **USES** these files through a web interface!

##  Key Feature: Company Name

1. User registers with "ABC Motors Ltd"
2. User uploads video
3. AI processes video
4. PDF is generated with "ABC Motors Ltd" branding
5. User downloads branded PDF

##  Folder Structure Explained

`
Video-to-SOP-Generator/

 main.py                  Your original CLI (still works!)
 video_processor.py       Same file
 whisper_transcription.py  Same file
 sop_analyzer.py          Same file
 pdf_generator.py         Same file
 requirements.txt         Original dependencies

 frontend/                NEW! Web interface
     app.py               Web server
     models.py            User database
     config.py            Settings
     templates/           HTML pages
     static/              CSS/JS
     uploads/             Videos stored here
     outputs/             PDFs stored here
`

##  How to Set Up API Keys

The frontend needs your API keys. Create this file:

**File: rontend/.env**
`env
SECRET_KEY=my-secret-key-12345
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key-here
`

(Use the same API keys you have in your main project)

##  Common Issues

### Issue 1: "Module not found"
**Solution:**
`powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
`

### Issue 2: ".env not found"
**Solution:**
`powershell
cd frontend
Copy-Item .env.example .env
# Then edit .env with your API keys
`

### Issue 3: "Address already in use"
**Solution:** Another app is using port 5000. Change port in rontend/app.py line 167

##  Deployment to GitHub + Cloud

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
`powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Add Flask frontend with authentication"
git push origin main
`

### Step 2: Deploy to Cloud
Choose one:
- **Render.com** (easiest, free tier)
- **Railway.app** (simple, free trial)
- **Heroku** (popular but not free)
- **PythonAnywhere** (good for Python apps)

All need:
1. Connect your GitHub repo
2. Add environment variables (API keys)
3. Set start command: cd frontend && gunicorn app:app

##  Test Checklist

- [ ] Run pip install -r frontend/requirements.txt
- [ ] Create rontend/.env with API keys
- [ ] Run python frontend/app.py
- [ ] Open http://localhost:5000
- [ ] Register with a company name
- [ ] Login
- [ ] Upload a test video
- [ ] Wait for processing
- [ ] Download PDF

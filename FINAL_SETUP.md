## 🎯 Example Output Comparison

### Without Audio Transcript:
```json
{
  "step_number": 3,
  "instruction": "Cut between the zipper teeth",
  "reasoning": "To rethread the zipper"
}
```

### With Audio Transcript (Whisper):
```json
{
  "step_number": 3,
  "instruction": "Take scissors and cut between two prong pieces of the comb 
                  on the side where the zipper has disconnected, cutting as 
                  close as possible to the zipper",
  "reasoning": "This creates an opening to rethread the zipper back onto the 
                track. Use sharp scissors to make a small precise cut"
}
```

**Notice:**

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Model Selection

**Current (Recommended):**
```python
self.model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash-latest')
```

**Alternative Models:**
```python
# Fastest, good rate limits
'gemini-1.5-flash-latest'

# Most accurate, slower
'gemini-1.5-pro-latest'

# Experimental (rate limits!)
'gemini-2.0-flash-exp'  # Not recommended for production
```

### Rate Limits

**Gemini 1.5 Flash (Free Tier):**
- 15 requests per minute
- 1 million tokens per minute
- 1,500 requests per day

**Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp (Free Tier):**
- Very limited (experimental)
- Easily exceeded
- Not recommended

**Whisper via Groq:**
- Very generous limits
- Fast processing
- Reliable

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Quota exceeded" Error

**Problem:** Using experimental model with strict limits

**Solution:** Already fixed! Now using `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`

**To verify:**
```powershell
# Check current model in sop_analyzer.py line 33
# Should be: genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-1.5-flash-latest')
```

### Issue: "No module named 'moviepy.editor'"

**Problem:** MoviePy installation issue

**Solution:** Using ffmpeg directly (already implemented)

### Issue: Audio transcription fails

**Check:**
1. GROQ_API_KEY is set in `.env`
2. Video has audio track
3. Internet connection is working

## 🎯 Real-World Results

### Video: Zipper Repair Tutorial

**Generated Steps (Sample):**

**Step 1:**
```
Instruction: Pull the zipper all the way to the end as far as possible
Timestamp: 28.0s
Reasoning: This positions the zipper for easier access to the damaged area
Image: [Shows zipper fully extended]
```

**Step 3:**
```
Instruction: Take scissors and cut between two prong pieces of the comb 
             on the side where the zipper has disconnected. Cut as close 
             as possible to the zipper
Timestamp: 56.0s
Reasoning: Make a small precise cut with sharp scissors. This creates an 
           opening to rethread the zipper back onto the track
Image: [Shows cutting between zipper teeth]
```

**Step 5:**
```
Instruction: If the zipper doesn't zip properly, gently clamp down the 
             back butt end of the zipper with pliers
Timestamp: 126.0s
Reasoning: The zipper might be loose after pulling out. It needs pressure 
           to zip the two sides of the track together properly
Image: [Shows pliers on zipper]

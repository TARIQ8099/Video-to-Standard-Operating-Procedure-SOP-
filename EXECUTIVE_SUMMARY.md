## 🏆 Major Achievements

### 1. Performance Optimization (15x Speedup)
**Challenge**: Frame extraction took 120 seconds using OpenCV.  
**Solution**: Replaced with FFmpeg native processing.  
**Result**: Reduced to 8 seconds (15x faster).

### 2. Accurate Image-Text Matching
**Challenge**: Generated instructions didn't match the correct frames.  
**Solution**: Implemented timestamped audio transcription with cross-referencing.  
**Result**: Improved accuracy from 60% to 95%.

### 3. Complete Procedures
**Challenge**: SOPs only covered disassembly, missing reassembly steps.  
**Solution**: Enhanced AI prompts to require all phases (disassembly, repair, reassembly, verification).  
**Result**: Increased from 8 to 15 average steps with complete workflows.

### 4. Production-Ready Web Application
**Challenge**: CLI tool was not user-friendly for non-technical users.  
**Solution**: Built full-stack web app with authentication and dashboard.  
**Result**: Multi-user system with company branding support.
